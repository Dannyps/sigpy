# Sigpy
This is a Sigarra Python API based on Recursive Web Scraping Parser (wtf). Essentially it performs requests as needed and parses the html information into objects you can use.

All of the main code is written and, other than bug fixing and enhancements, you will only need to edit `.json` files!


In the end, this is yet another Sigarra-based project that I wished existed before I needed something like it.

## Examples
```python
from sigpy import get_faculty

# get faculty object and login
fac = get_faculty("feup")
# login is optional but gives access to more information
fac.login("201403027", "youWish")
# if no password is given, secret prompt will appear

# access student data!
msr = fac.get_student("UP201403027") # up is case insensitive and also unnecessary
print(msr) # complete JSON view of student information


# access course data!
mieic = fac.get_course(msr.courses[1].id) # pass the id of msr's second course (which is MIEIC)
print(mieic)

# access teacher data!
pascoal = fac.get_teacher(mieic.director.id) # use the id of the course director

fotogenico = fac.get_picture(pascoal) # temporarily download picture
fotogenico.show() # shows image in external program
fotogenico.save() # saves image as "images/ID.jpg"
fotogenico.save("another/dir") # custom dir, absolute or relative to script
```

## Contributing
Essentially, there is a lot to do, most of it is _web scraping_ work:
 - Add more fields to current classes
 - Create new classes
 - Create new classes for other faculties (only feup supported at the moment)
If you have some of the following skills, you can help already:
 - Knowledge of HTML
 - Knowledge of CSS selectors
 - Knowledge of REGEX
 - Knowledge of XPATH
 - Knowledge of Python

#### Project Organization
Inside the sigpy folder you will find:
 * üìÅ classes
    * [model.py](sigpy/classes/model.py) (wrapper class for parsed objects)
    * [picture.py](sigpy/classes/picture.py) (class for picture handling)
 * üìÅ faculties (contains one folder per faculty)
    * üìÅ feup (contains `.json` files specifying parsing rules)
        * [__init__.py](sigpy/faculties/feup/__init__.py) (file where the urls are defined as they can be dynamic)
        * course.json
        * room.json
        * student.json
        * ...
    * üìÅ fcup ...
        * __init__.py
        * ...
    * ...

each of the `class.json` files has the following format:
```json
{
    "url": "____",
    "picture": "picture (this is optional and usually just for people)",
    "attributes": {
        "attr1": {"css": "some css selector"},
        "attr2": {"regex": "some css selector"},
        "attr3": {"xpath": "some css selector"},
        "attr4": {"derivate": "some css selector", "from": ["attr1"]},
        "attr5": {
            "list": "True",
            "model": "a list of what?",
            "css": "to find the first element, ",
            "attributes: {
                ...
            }
        }
        ...
    }
}
```
Notice that it is recursive and one attribute can be a model and have some other attribute that is also a model, _ad infinitum_
```python
{
    "url": "student", # url name for loading this resource (it is not here because JSON is static)
    "picture": "picture",  # url name for getting pictures
    "attributes": { # attributes a student can have
        "name": {"css": "div.estudante-info-nome"},  # the name is filtered through a css selector
        "id": {"css": "div.estudante-info-numero a"}, # the same goes for id
        "email": {"derivate": "up%s@fe.up.pt", "from": ["id"]},  # derivate means it will be formatted using another attribute after loading, using python formatting features like: student.email = "up%s@fe.up.pt" % student.id
        # this is a rare attribute type
        "courses": { # if the attribute is a list instead of a value
            "model": "course",  # model works as class
            "list": "True",  # omission means single, so this is a list of "course"
            "css": "div.estudante-lista-curso-activo", # how to find each eleement of the list to iterate
            "attributes": { # this is just as the student model, its just inside another model, recursivity!!
                "name": {"css": "div.estudante-lista-curso-nome"},
                "institution": {"css": "div.estudante-lista-curso-instit"},
                "id": {"regex": ".*pv_curso_id=(\d+).*"},  # in this case REGEX is used to search the HTML for the attribute id (must be in a REGEX capture group)
                "enrolled": {"xpath": ".//td[text()='Ano da primeira inscri√ß√£o:']/following::td[1]"}, # if CSS and REGEX are not enough, you can get all the power of XPATH
                "year": {"xpath": ".//td[text()='Ano curricular atual:']/following::td[1]"},
                "state": {"xpath": ".//td[text()='Estado atual:']/following::td[1]"}
            }
        },
        "inactive_courses": { # Another attribute that is a list
            "model": "course",
            "list": "True",
            "css": "div.tabela-longa",
            "attributes": {
                "name": {"css": "td.t.k"},
                "id": {"regex": ".*pv_curso_id=(\d+).*"},
                "institution": {"xpath": ".//tr[@class='i']/td[2]/a/@title"},
                "old_id": {"css": "td.l"},
                "type": {"css": "td.t", "index": 2},
                "started": {"css": "td.l", "index": 1}
            }
        }
    }
}
